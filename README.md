# YApocalypse

Created by Yangon Academy Programming Class 2018-19

This is a collaborative class project to create an interactive mini game of navigating a post-apocalyptic themed Yangon Academy. The game is originally written in Python and uses the Pygame library. The program is converted to a WASM file using Pygbag to run on a web browser. Check out web version of the game [here](https://cecilzha.github.io/YApocalypse).

  ## Story

  Noone is at Mr. Lee’s classroom

  Picture of normal classroom with people. Background noise of crowd. Screen blurs and fades to black. There is a specific math problem on the board. Noone wakes up disoriented and tries to shake it off. 

  The door is open and the classroom is very dark messy enough to look like people ran out in a hurry. The math problem is still on the board, although some parts of it are erased in a messy manner. 

  Noone gets up to get a closer look at the whiteboard. 

  There is an answer written on the board. There is also a date written on the board in red, 29/Apr/2019. Noone should remember this information. 

  Noone leaves the classroom. He is now in building 1, floor 2 hallway. 

  Nobody is in the hallway, it’s empty. Noone thinks to himself, “What happened here? Where is everyone?”

  Noone continues along the hall. He notices the elevator. It’s not working. The door leading to the stairs is open. Next to that door there is the IT room, it’s locked. He should look for a key somewhere. He goes to the door and observes it. “It looks like someone left this door open in a hurry.” 

  “I should look around and figure out what happened. Where might they keep the keys?” 

  Noone heads on downstairs and arrives by the maintenance room. By the elevator near the maintenance room, there is a poster that says “EVERYTHING HAPPENS FOR A REASON.” Next to it is a Star Wars poster that says “ANAKIN SKYWALKER, THE CHOSEN ONE.” Next to it is a poster announcing there is a chemistry experiment with fire on April 29, 2019. “ALL STUDENTS MUST BRING SAFETY GOGGLES.”

  Noone goes into the maintenance room and collects, “KEYS.” “Access to every door in the building.”

  Noone goes up to the IT room, opens the door and discovers that the power is off. Next to the computer is a small note: “HAPPY BIRTHDAY.” 

  Noone goes down to building 2 and has to turn on the generator. He realizes that he saw an announcement about how there was an experiment with fire in the chemistry room. 

  Noone goes to the chemistry room and gets, “A CAN OF GAS.” In the chemistry room, there is a notice on the board that says, “If you are caught sleeping in class, you will be SUSPENDED.” 

  Noone goes back down, and faces an extremely dark hallway towards the generator. 

  Noone thinks to himself, “Hmm, I think I would need to look for a flashlight better check the library since the librarian has everything.” 

  Noone can go to the library, where he can pick up a book about a man who travelled in time. The book name is “Back to the Future”. 

  Noone finds a flashlight on the shelf next to the book and grabs it.

  Noone advances back to building 2 and used the flashlight to light up the dark hallway.

  Noone puts gas in the generator and turns it on. 

  Everything in both building 1 and 2 is lit up except for the Mr. Fluge’s room. 

  Noone can choose to enter it or ignore it but if Noone enters the room with a flashlight in his inventory, he will see some of the game creators looking at Noone, surprised and frozen.

  Noone can also choose to go to Dr. Adam’s room and it will be lit up by the generator. If Noone enters the room he will see all of the members of the game creators working on the game but frozen in time. 

  Noone then goes back to building 1 and sees a blinding light (portal) coming from the elevator. He can choose between going into the elevator or going to the IT room.

  Noone goes back to the IT Room, there is a password on the main computer. 

  Noone enters the birthday as password and the computer opens. The wallpaper is about CHAOS THEORY. There is only one document on the computer. “DIARY ENTRY, 30TH APRIL 2019, EVERYTHING IS CHAOS. WHAT COULD HAVE CAUSED THIS?” 

  Noone can go to the time machine “ELEVATOR” now and go to the past. He can now change the past by not falling asleep in class.

  Noone sees a cup of coffee and a carton of milk on his desk. He chooses coffee. He doesn’t fall asleep. 

  Noone is sucked back to the future. Everyone is there, everything is ok. 
  
  THE END.
